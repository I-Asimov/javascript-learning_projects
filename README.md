# JavaScript Learning Projects 
Hi there! 👋

I'm a beginner in JavaScript, and I created this repo to **learn, experiment, make mistakes, and grow from them**.  
Here you'll find:
- Simple JS projects (prompt-based apps, DOM manipulations, basic calculators, etc.)  
- Small web apps with HTML and CSS  
- My experiments and trial-and-error learning
---
**Important Note:**  
- These projects are **not professional**; they are purely for learning and practice.  
- My code may contain mistakes, and every mistake is a lesson.  
- If you see an error or have suggestions, feel free to open an issue or a pull request!  
---
**About the Projects:**  
- Each project is in its own folder.  
- Folder names reflect the project content.  
---
Thanks for stopping by!  
This repo is open for anyone who wants to see my mistakes and follow my learning journey.  
My motivation: **keep learning without being afraid of mistakes**.
